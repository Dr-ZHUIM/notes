# What is DNS ?
DNS is the abbreviation for the Domain Name System and it is used as a phonebook to the Internet.  

## What can DNS Do ?
DNS helps people to access information online through domain names, like github.com or google.com.

## How DNS Does it work ?
Web browsers interact through Internet Procotol(IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so your browser load Internet resources.
